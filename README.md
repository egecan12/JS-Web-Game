# The Delights of Constantinople 2019

It is a web game develop on Phaser.js and Node.js.

You can also send your high score to MongoDB at the end of the game.

I did not spen too much time on it so It may look broken on some browsers so Chrome is recomended. 
There is only 2 episodes waiting to be developed but yu can test it out.
